  <summary>Hospital Management System</summary>
  <p>
   
    The Hospital Management System (HMS) Organized into clinics,
    Each Clinic has a name, working hours, floor number and doctors who manage the clinic.
    We keep track of medical stuff’s first and last name, age, gender,specialization, shifting time,
    year of employment and contact number. The Medical Stuff Includes (Doctors - Receptionist).
    
    Each Doctor writes a detailed Report for each Outpatient describing the Medicines the Patient took,
    the duration Patient spent and his conditional illness.
    Receptionist records the Appointment, Patient NID and description and assigns Patients to a Room.
    
    Each Room has a unique number, floor number, number of beds and taken beds.
    
    The HMS keeps track of Patient’s National ID number, full name,
    conditional illness, responsible Doctor, and the room he stayed at.
    
    For each Outpatient he must check for the Bill by giving the Receptionist the Report,
    Written by the Doctor and pay for that Bill which includes Bill number, Patient name,
    Medicine taken, in/out date and total treatment afford.
  
    The HMS also keeps track of the current available Medicine’s code number, name, quantity, and price.
